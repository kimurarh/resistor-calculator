# Resistor Color Code

A pattern of colored bands is used to indicate the values and characteristics of a resistor (an electronic component). 

The first three bands represent digits in the value of resistance. Then next one represents a multiplier band to signify moving the decimal right or left. The last two bands represent tolerance and the temperature coefficient. 

## Project
The main idea of this App is to decode the resistor characteristics according to the colors selected by the user.

### Future changes
* Let the user choose between 4, 5 and 6 bands resistors
* Find a better way to change the colors in Javascript according to what the user selected
* Change the resistor structure (html/css)
